# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at `src/app/page.tsx`.

## How to Publish Your Website

This project is configured for deployment with [Firebase App Hosting](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-hosting).

When you're ready to go live, you can deploy your application using the Firebase CLI.

1.  **Install the Firebase CLI:** If you don't have it, install it on your local machine:
    ```bash
    npm install -g firebase-tools
    ```

2.  **Login to Firebase:**
    ```bash
    firebase login
    ```

3.  **Deploy your app:** From your project's root directory, run the following command:
    ```bash
    firebase deploy
    ```

And that's it! The CLI will build your Next.js application and deploy it to Firebase App Hosting.
